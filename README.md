# Hello! üëã

Thank you for the opportunity to showcase some of my data analysis skills! üòä

## Project Overview

This project is broken down into three main components:

### 1. Data Analysis Page üìä

This page contains various plots and interactive features to explore the structure of the data and draw insights from different statistics, distributions, and correlations. These insights can help make more informed decisions about dealing with products and purchases given a variety of factors.

- The page begins with a drop-down menu of the various features I have built to view the data in different ways. If you prefer to see everything at once, just keep scrolling down the page to view all visualizations. I encourage you to engage with the interactive plots I have made. Although I aimed to create more interactive features, I hope the existing ones demonstrate my skill in this area.

A few things to keep in mind:
- I added a volume dimension to each product since I was given height, weight, and depth. Although this volume is not accurate for each product, as not every product is a cube, I hope it can serve as a heuristic for estimating the average volume of each product.
- There is definitely a lot more analysis to be done and different angles to consider, but I believe this is a good starting point for further exploration.

### 2. Query Tool üîç

While navigating the data, I found that cross-referencing information about specific products or purchases across multiple files can be exhausting. So, I created an easy way to find information about a purchase and product. Additionally, I included a feature to find information about purchases made on a given day. The goal is to make it easy for a user to quickly check specific details about a product, purchase, and its date.

### 3. Modeling Page ü§ñ

This page aims to provide a simplified prediction tool to estimate how many times a product will be purchased on a given day. I utilized a variety of models to see how each one performs. Although there hasn‚Äôt been extensive hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering, this page acts as a skeleton to build upon and find the best forecasting methodology for a product.

- The interface is straightforward: enter a product ID, select a model type, and choose the date for which you want to predict the purchase count for that product.

***DISCLAIMER:*** This page runs slowly and may take a while to load each time a new model, date, or product ID is entered. I wanted to optimize it further, but for now, to demonstrate its utility, I have left it as it is due to time constraints. Please be patient; it can be tricky to use, but it works! 

## Conclusion üìà

The conclusion page will go over some interesting findings from the data, useful insights, and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, it will outline the next steps to further refine this project and enhance its utility.

## Once again, thank you so much for this opportunity. I look forward to hearing back and hopefully joining the team!

# üìä Conclusion

## Missing Values üõ†Ô∏è 
Looking at the data, it seems that the categories with the most missing values are primarily related to product dimensions. Moving forward, we should aim to fill these missing values. This could be done using k-means clustering or other methods. I also acknowledge that some products may inherently lack certain dimension values due to their shape or size, but this should be specified and well-documented.

## Correlations üîó 
Examining a correlation heatmap between product dimensions, we see there is very little to no correlation between them. The only relatively higher correlation is between product depth and volume.

## Quick Stats of Products by Department üìà 
From the product dimensions bar plot, a few interesting observations were made:

- **Weight**: Pets and Alcohol departments had the heaviest products on average.
- **Height and Volume**: Lifestyle department products were tallest and had the highest volume.
- **Number of Products**: Snacks and Personal Care departments had the most products.

The top 10 most purchased products were part of the Produce department, indicating that most purchases are for produce items.

## Looking at Changes Over Time ‚è≥
We only have data for a few weeks from the end of March to mid-April of 2020. During this period, there was a sharp increase in product purchases starting in early April, peaking at about 3700 products bought on April 6. After that, the trend sharply declines, suggesting that most products are purchased at the beginning of the month.

Products in each department follow a similar trend, with food-related purchases (e.g., Produce, Dairy and Eggs, Pantry) showing more significant fluctuations, while other departments exhibit a flatter trend. Examining purchases by the hour, we see that most are made around midday. The most popular products bought at each hour are from the Produce department, while the least bought products vary across departments.

## Comments on Modeling Tool ü§ñ
I used a variety of models to run predictions on purchases for a specific product. The best performers were Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. Other models such as Support Vector Regression, Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression did not perform as well, highlighting the importance of models that fit nonlinear data better than linear models. In the future, I would like to test how a neural network performs. Once the best models are identified, I plan to conduct additional feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to build an accurate prediction tool.

## Next Steps üöÄ 
From the data analysis, we can find ways to better handle product fulfillment based on the time of day and month. Using the prediction tool, we could implement better systems to manage future orders and be better prepared. By analyzing dimensions and product information for each department, we could further customize processes to improve operations. Much more analysis and model tuning is needed, but there are many areas to optimize and develop.

## Thank you for checking out my project. I would be happy to answer any questions about how I built it, my thought process, future steps, and feedback. I had a lot of fun doing this and am excited to see how I can further contribute. I look forward to the next steps! üéâ
