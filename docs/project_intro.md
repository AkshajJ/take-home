# Hello Fulfil Team! üëã

Thank you for the opportunity to showcase some of my data analysis skills! üòä

## Project Overview

This project is broken down into three main components:

### 1. Data Analysis Page üìä

This page contains various plots and interactive features to explore the structure of the data and draw insights from different statistics, distributions, and correlations. These insights can help make more informed decisions about dealing with products and purchases given a variety of factors.

- The page begins with a drop-down menu of the various features I have built to view the data in different ways. If you prefer to see everything at once, just keep scrolling down the page to view all visualizations. I encourage you to engage with the interactive plots I have made. Although I aimed to create more interactive features, I hope the existing ones demonstrate my skill in this area.

A few things to keep in mind:
- I added a volume dimension to each product since I was given height, weight, and depth. Although this volume is not accurate for each product, as not every product is a cube, I hope it can serve as a heuristic for estimating the average volume of each product.
- There is definitely a lot more analysis to be done and different angles to consider, but I believe this is a good starting point for further exploration.

### 2. Query Tool üîç

While navigating the data, I found that cross-referencing information about specific products or purchases across multiple files can be exhausting. So, I created an easy way to find information about a purchase and product. Additionally, I included a feature to find information about purchases made on a given day. The goal is to make it easy for a user to quickly check specific details about a product, purchase, and its date.

### 3. Modeling Page ü§ñ

This page aims to provide a simplified prediction tool to estimate how many times a product will be purchased on a given day. I utilized a variety of models to see how each one performs. Although there hasn‚Äôt been extensive hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering, this page acts as a skeleton to build upon and find the best forecasting methodology for a product.

- The interface is straightforward: enter a product ID, select a model type, and choose the date for which you want to predict the purchase count for that product.

***DISCLAIMER:*** This page runs slowly and may take a while to load each time a new model, date, or product ID is entered. I wanted to optimize it further, but for now, to demonstrate its utility, I have left it as it is due to time constraints. Please be patient; it can be tricky to use, but it works! 

## Conclusion üìà

The conclusion page will go over some interesting findings from the data, useful insights, and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, it will outline the next steps to further refine this project and enhance its utility.

## Once again, thank you so much for this opportunity. I look forward to hearing back and hopefully joining the team!
